# Session 6: Prompt Anatomy & Best Practices

## Overview

Complete these hands-on exercises to master the 6-component prompt engineering framework. Each exercise builds your skills in creating precise, effective prompts for real development scenarios.

## Setup Instructions

1. Fork the AI Club repo and create your branch: `session-6-prompt-anatomy-YOUR-NAME`
2. Navigate to `session-6-prompt-anatomy/exercises/`
3. Check challenges in `challenges` folder and complete each exercise in order
4. Document your results in the provided templates
5. Test your prompts with your preferred AI tool (Claude, Copilot, ChatGPT)

## Submission Instructions

### What to Submit

1. All exercise files completed
2. Your tested prompt library (10 templates total)
3. A reflection document: `my-key-learnings.md` with:

# Session 4: Prompt Engineering for Software Developers
## AI Club - The Gym | May 14, 2025

---

## Session Overview (60 minutes)
- **10 min:** Quick wins and challenges from previous week
- **20 min:** Hands-on demonstration and explanation
- **25 min:** Workshop/Practice time
- **5 min:** Assignment and next week preview

---

## Slide 1: Quick Wins & Challenges Check-in (10 min)
### Interactive Discussion
**"Let's hear from you - what's working and what's frustrating?"**

#### Common Wins üéâ
- Fast code generation for simple functions
- Quick debugging assistance with Copilot
- Documentation help and comments

#### Common Challenges üò§
- Inconsistent output quality
- Too generic solutions that need heavy modification
- AI doesn't understand project context
- Spending more time fixing AI code than writing it yourself

**Activity:** Go around the room - everyone shares one AI interaction from this week (good or bad)

---

## Slide 2: The Hidden Cost of Bad Prompts
### Reality Check
**Most developers waste 60% of their AI interactions due to poor prompting**

#### ‚ùå What We Usually Do
```
"Create a login component"
```
**Result:** Generic, no validation, missing types, doesn't match our design system

#### ‚úÖ What We Should Do
```
You are a senior React developer working with React 19, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS 4.

Create a login component for our dashboard app with:
- Email and password fields with proper validation
- Loading states during authentication
- Error handling for failed login attempts
- Responsive design using TailwindCSS 4
- TypeScript interfaces for props and form data
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

Follow our design system: use blue-600 for primary actions, rounded-lg borders, and shadow-sm for form elements.

Return the component with proper JSDoc comments and a usage example.
```

**The difference:** 5 minutes of thoughtful prompting saves 30 minutes of modifications

## Slide 3: Anatomy of a Perfect Prompt
### The 6 Essential Components

```
[ROLE] You are a senior React developer with TypeScript expertise

[CONTEXT] Working on a e-commerce dashboard using React 19 + Vite + TailwindCSS 4

[TASK] Create a product card component that displays product info and handles cart actions

[FORMAT] TypeScript component with JSDoc, responsive design, proper prop types

[CONSTRAINTS] Must be accessible, handle loading states, follow our design system

[EXAMPLES] 
Input: { name: "MacBook Pro", price: 1299, image: "/mac.jpg", inStock: true }
Output: Card with image, title, price, add-to-cart button with loading state
```

**The Formula:** Context + Task + Format + Constraints + Examples = Predictable Excellence

---

## Slide 4: Live Demo - Transformation in Action (15 min)
### üéØ Challenge: Create a REST API data fetching hook

**We'll transform this together, live!**

#### Before: Vague Request
```
"Create a hook to fetch data from an API"
```

#### After: Let's Build This Together!
**Follow along as we apply the 6-component framework:**

1. **ROLE:** What expertise do we need?
2. **CONTEXT:** What's our tech stack and project needs?
3. **TASK:** What specific functionality?
4. **FORMAT:** How should the code be structured?
5. **CONSTRAINTS:** What requirements must we meet?
6. **EXAMPLES:** What inputs/outputs do we expect?

**Live Demo Project:** Create `useApiData` hook for product fetching
- We'll start with a bad prompt
- Transform it using our framework
- Test it with Claude/Copilot
- Compare the results

## Slide 10: Common Prompt Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå The 5 Deadly Prompt Mistakes

1. **Being Too Vague**
   - Bad: "Make this component better"

2. **Missing Context**
   - Bad: "Fix this React hook"  
   - Good: "Fix this React 19 hook that's causing memory leaks in our dashboard app"

3. **Wrong Expectations**
   - Bad: "Build me a complete e-commerce app"
   - Good: "Create a product listing component with pagination and filtering"

4. **Ignoring Constraints**
   - Bad: "Create a form component"
   - Good: "Create a form component following our design system, accessible, with proper TypeScript types"

5. **No Examples**
   - Bad: "Handle user data"
   - Good: "Handle user data like: `{id: 1, name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com', role: 'admin'}`"

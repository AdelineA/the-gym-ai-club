## Exercise 2: Live Demo Follow-Along (During Session)

### Goal

Follow along with the live demo and practice the transformation process in real-time.

### The Challenge: useApiData Hook

We'll start with this vague request and transform it together:

```
"Create a hook to fetch data from an API"
```

### Your Role

1. **Participate** in building the structured prompt
2. **Take notes** on each component as we build it
3. **Test the result** with your AI tool
4. **Compare** your output with others

### Context for Demo

- **Project:** E-commerce dashboard
- **Tech Stack:** React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS 4
- **Use Case:** Fetching product data with loading states and error handling
- **API:** REST endpoint returning product arrays

### Fill in as we go:

```

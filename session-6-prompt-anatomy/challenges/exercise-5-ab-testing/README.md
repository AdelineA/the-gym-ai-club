## Exercise 5: A/B Testing Different Prompt Approaches (15 min)

### Goal

Learn how small changes in prompts can dramatically affect output quality.

### The Scenario

You need a TypeScript interface for a user profile component.

### Test These Variations

#### Version A: Minimal Context

```
Create a TypeScript interface for a user profile with name, email, and avatar.
```

#### Version B: Moderate Context

```
You are a TypeScript developer. Create an interface for a user profile component that includes name, email, avatar URL, and account status. Make it type-safe and include proper documentation.
```

#### Version C: Full 6-Component Structure

```
[Build this using the complete framework we learned]
```

### Your Task

1. **Test all three versions** with the same AI tool
    
2. **Compare the outputs** for:
    
    - Code quality
    - Documentation quality
    - TypeScript best practices
    - Completeness
    - Usability
3. **Document the differences** in detail
    

### Deliverable

Create: `exercise-5-ab-testing.md` with your comparison analysis.
